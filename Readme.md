# Schemey

This is me following along with
[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)
but with some of my own thoughts interjected (e.g., automatic partial function
application) producing something that is Scheme-like, but definitely not a
valid Scheme.
